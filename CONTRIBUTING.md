# Contributing to Code Guide
Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

## Questions and issues
Guidelines are by nature debatable. If anything is unclear, confusing or seems plain wrong please:

* [create an issue](https://github.com/andyet/code-guide/issues) 
* tag it with `question` label.

## Pull requests
Please **ask first** before submitting a pull request, otherwise you are spending time on something that might not be merged into the project. 

Since those guidelines are preferences (backed up by some of the brightest minds of the industry, but still preferences) before intending on submitting a pull request follow the steps in [Questions and issues](#questions-and-issues) section.

This document was inspired by Nicolas Gallagher's [issue guidelines](https://github.com/necolas/issue-guidelines/). Thank you, Nicolas.
